# Essays
This project is part of an interview assignment, so I will avoid sharing the data or problem specifics publicly.
The goal of this project is to train 2 models, 1 for each trait, in a given group of essays. I constructed a
solution that tracks, packages, and manages the models made, which are important for machine learning systems.
These models can also be run on other traits without too many modifications.

I currently have at least 2 models but have not finished exploring the ML algorithms using auto-sklearn.
I will give the algorithm/hyperparameter search more time to run tomorrow.

## Entry points
I have created 4 entry points, which can be run from the command line as follows (once the requisite packages have been installed):

```
$ mlflow run essayproject -e clean --env-manager=local  # (finishing up on my side before I push changes)
$ mlflow run essayproject -e exploration --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e sklearn --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e transformers --env-manager=local
```

## Some initial analysis (more to come)
Some trends appear in the data that could potentially be leveraged for a machine learning model. For example, you can see in the 
image below that the highest scored essays have fewer noun subjects and more punctuation than other essays for trait 1.

That same trend also appears for trait 2.

In total, though, we see marginally more nouns and punctuation and fewer pronouns and verbs in the higher scored essays for both traits.

There is a general trend for higher scored essays to be longer as well, though not always.

## Work left to do
1. I intend to incorporate error analysis (via LIME) into this ML lifecycle.
2. I have tests to add as well, which I used with Transformers.
3. I have some cleaning up to do.
