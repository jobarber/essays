# Essays
This project is part of an interview assignment, so I will avoid sharing the data or problem specifics publicly.
The goal of this project is to train 2 models, 1 for each trait, in a given group of essays. I constructed a
solution that tracks, packages, and manages the models made, which are important for machine learning systems.
These models can also be run on other traits without too many modifications.

I currently have several models (in a variety of formats). 

## Current results
The dataset has a lot of overlap between the language that appears for scores 3 and 4--for both traits.
There could be a number of reasons for this. For example, perhaps annotators/graders did not consistently differentiate
between the two scores, and the two scores should be collapsed into one score. I tried making this a binary 
problem to see if that would help (scores 1-3 on the one
hand and scores 4-6 for trait 1 or just 4 by itself for trait 2), but it helped only marginally. Here are the
current confusion matrices for the top scoring RoBERTa model on traits 1 and 2. Note that the scores in these images are
index scores and are thus 1 lower than the corresponding score label.

Trait 1

Trait 2

I have tried Transformer models, sklearn models, and a number of other models through AWS. I also generated additional
samples for essay scores with really low counts. (I uploaded the generated samples to this repo.) The RoBERTa model
does best so far. The dataset is highly imbalanced, and the scores the most common
scores are 3 and 4--the scores with language overlap--for both classes. The optimizing metric I chose is Matthews
correlation coefficient (MCC). Unlike the F1-score and other measures, the MCC is symmetric and essentially
measures the correlation between classes without be impacted by class imbalances.

There is also a fair bit of noise in the data, which I have questions about. A number of tokens beginning
with an @ sign are scattered throughout the essays.

Here are the current results:

Overall_MCC_test	0.432
| Trait | Model | Ensemble? | Overall MCC Valid. Score | Train Loss | Valid. Loss |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Trait 1 | RoBERTa  | No | 0.668  | 0.537 | 0.393 |
| Trait 2 | RoBERTa  | No | 0.773 | 0.377 | 0.175 |
| Trait 1 | lda  | No | 0.432  | 0.247843 | 0.303251 |
| Trait 2 | lda  | No | 0.443  | 0.290339 | 0.330013 |
| Trait 1 | lda/mlp | Yes | 0.421 | (multiple) | (multiple) |
| Trait 2 | lda/mlp/gb/knn | Yes | 0.427  | (multiple) | (multiple) |

Per-class accuracies for RoBERTa on the eval dataset. (The model is quite fast for a Transformer
due to some modifications that I have made. It cuold be made even faster for deployment.)

| Score | Trait 1 Accuracy | Trait 2 Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| 2 | .989 | 1.0 |
| 3 | .801 | 0.853 |
| 4 | .800 | 0.853 |
| 5 | 1.0 | - |
| 6 | 1.0 | - |

The models are too big to upload to GitHub, but I can look for another way to share them if desired.

## Entry points
I have created 4 entry points, which can be run from the command line.

First, activate the virtual environment and install the `requirements.txt`.

```
$ source /home/ubuntu/.virtualenvs/<company>/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run any of the commands in the MLProject file. For example,
you can run any of these.

```
$ mlflow run essayproject -e clean --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e exploration --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e sklearn --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e autosklearn --env-manager=local
$ mlflow run essayproject -e transformers --env-manager=local
```

Results of each run can be seen through the mlflow UI:

```
$ mlflow ui -h 127.0.0.1:5000
```

Or UI results can be served from a remote server:

```
$ mlflow ui -h 0.0.0.0:5000
```

## Some initial analysis
Some trends appear in the data that could potentially be leveraged for a machine learning model. For example, you can see in the 
image below that the highest scored essays have fewer noun subjects and more punctuation than other essays for trait 1.

That same trend also appears for trait 2.

In total, though, we see marginally more nouns and punctuation and fewer pronouns and verbs in the higher scored essays for both traits.

There is a general trend for higher scored essays to be longer as well, though not always.
